# Global Happiness Analytics 2024

An analytical exploration of the **World Happiness Report 2024**, focusing on the relationship between GDP, social factors and perceived well-being across countries and continents.

Developed as part of the *Master in Data Science and Engineering* coursework at **FEUP (Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto)** in collaboration with **Kirill Savin** and **Diego Montoya**

## Project Objective

To analyze the structural components of national happiness scores and identify:

- The relationship between **GDP and happiness**
- Continental differences in well-being
- Key drivers of high-performing countries
- Average contribution of explanatory factors worldwide

The goal was not only to model the data, but to extract **interpretable insights with socio-economic relevance**.

## Dataset

- Source: World Happiness Report 2024
- Observations: Countries worldwide
- Variables include:
  - Ladder Score (Happiness score)
  - GDP per capita
  - Social support
  - Life expectancy
  - Freedom
  - Generosity
  - Corruption perception
  - Dystopia residual

----

## Analytical Approach

The analysis included:

- Global choropleth mapping of happiness distribution
- GDP vs Happiness scatter analysis with continent averages
- Decomposition of happiness score by contributing factors
- Top 15 happiest countries comparative analysis
- Factor contribution averages worldwide

All visualizations were developed in **R**, focusing on clarity and interpretability.

----

## Key Insights

- GDP strongly correlates with happiness, but does not fully explain it.
- Social support is one of the most consistent contributors across top countries.
- Continental averages reveal structural socio-economic differences.
- Freedom and governance indicators differentiate countries with similar GDP levels.

## Technologies Used

- R
- ggplot2
- dplyr
- tidyr
- sf (spatial visualization)

----

## Professional Focus

This project emphasizes:

- Analytical reasoning
- Interpretation of statistical relationships
- Socio-economic insight extraction
- Clear visual communication of data

It reflects my interest in **decision-oriented data analysis**, where statistical modeling supports strategic understanding rather than purely technical optimization.
